# Remix Project

Welcome to our Remix project! This project is designed to provide a modern web development experience, utilizing Remix to manage various aspects of the application from development to deployment.

## Project Description

This project aims to create a scalable and efficient web application using the Remix framework. By leveraging Remix, we ensure that our application is optimized for both server-side and client-side rendering, providing a seamless user experience. The project is structured to facilitate easy development, testing, and deployment, making it suitable for both small and large-scale applications.

## Development

To run the development server, use the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

To deploy your application, first build it for production:

```shell
npm run build
```

Then, run the application in production mode:

```shell
npm start
```

Now you'll need to choose a host to deploy your application.

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`:

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This project uses [Vanilla Extract CSS](https://vanilla-extract.style/) for styling, providing a type-safe, zero-runtime CSS-in-TypeScript approach. This allows for a highly customizable and maintainable styling solution. You can explore the [Vanilla Extract documentation](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation) for more information on how to utilize it effectively in your project.
